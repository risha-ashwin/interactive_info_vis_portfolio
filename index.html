        <p>
          I chose to create a dancer poses clock because I love to dance and I’m on a dance team.
          I thought it would be a fun way to show time using different poses.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This clock is for dancers, and it could be used during practice to quickly tell the time by
            looking at the different poses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used the legs and hands of the big dancer in the center so the poses are easy
            to read and the “clock hands” don’t overlap too much. I also used color to show which limbs are acting as the
            clock hands, and I made the hour hand thicker so it’s easier to distinguish from the minute hand. I included
            a key above the clock so users understand how to read it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I would design each pose to look more like the number it represents,
            so it’s easier to read at a quick glance. I would also clean up the big dancer design to look more visually
            appealing overall.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I chose to create a progress ring clock to visually show the progression of time.
          The outer ring represents the hour, the middle ring represents the minute, and the inner ring
          represents the second.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This clock could be used by students or runners who want to quickly
            understand how time is progressing at a glance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I made each ring a different color so the different units
            of time are easy to distinguish from one another. I also included tick marks so users, such
            as runners, can count time more precisely if they want to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> If I were to iterate on this clock, I would add additional rings
            for the day and year. I would also include text at the top to provide more detailed time
            information.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I created a candle clock as a calming and relaxing way to tell time.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This clock is intended for students who are studying and want a
            more calming way to keep track of time while helping reduce stress.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used blue and yellow to represent AM and PM. I included
            markers along the candle so users can count time more precisely, while also adding text at
            the top so the time can be understood quickly at a glance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I would improve the overall visual appeal of the
            clock. The blue and yellow dots along the side of the candle were originally meant to represent
            melting wax to show the passage of time, and I would work on implementing that idea more clearly.
          </li>
        </ul>
